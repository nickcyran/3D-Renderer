# 3D-Renderer
(WIP) </br>

Building a 3D graphics renderer in Java only utilizing 2D graphics libraries (AWT). 
All matrix math and perspective projection algorithms are built from the ground up, 
working towards the total completion of the rendering pipeline coverting 3D objects into 2D representations.

### What's implemented:
<ul>
  <li>Full normalized camera controls</li>
  <li>Perspective projection</li>
  <li>3D Objects</li>
  <li>Triangle assembly</li>
  <li>Rasterization</li>
</ul>

### What's my next step?:
Next up is: Z-buffering

## How to use
Download the 'RendererApp.jar' file and run it!

### Controls:
Camera position - WASD </br>
Camera up - spacebar </br>
Camera down - shift </br>
Camera tilt - arrow keys
